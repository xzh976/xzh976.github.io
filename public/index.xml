      <description>Biography I am now a RA studying in CUHK (SZ). I am studying Computational photography. Before that, I have worked in Westlake University as RA, studying Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging. In 2022, I received my master degree in the Sichuan University (Project 985 in China), supervised by Pro. Wei LI, studying deep learning, image/ video object detection and image video processing.
Skills: Pytorch, Python, Matlab, Protus, AutoCAD, PS, PR, Procreat</description>

      <description>Project Research on Computational photography
• Based on the characteristics of images and system, an algorithm framework for video denoising is developed.
• Learned ISP processing, camera system, HDR fusion and noise calibration.
Research on Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging
• Utilized PnP framework, which combined deep learning denoising method with traditional optimization method.
• Applied the self-supervised denoising method in the PnP framework to achieve a self-supervised video snapshot compressive imaging.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent Go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in Go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using Go templates.</description>

      <description>Step 1. Install Hugo Go to Hugo releases and download the appropriate version for your OS and architecture.
Save it somewhere specific as we will be using it in the next step.
More complete instructions are available at Install Hugo
Step 2. Build the Docs Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site you are reading right now.
Follow the following steps:
Clone the Hugo repository Go into the repo Run hugo in server mode and build the docs Open your browser to http://localhost:1313 Corresponding pseudo commands:</description>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>
